<p align="Left">
The Basic scripting process is divided as below: <br />
 <br />
    - In the First basic <a href="https://github.com/V4g4b0nd/Webscrapping/blob/main/basic_scrape.py"> Script <a>, we are using a Amazon product page and is printing out the "Price" of that product <br />
    - We need to right click on that page and click inspect and find the "class" parameter of the price and put it in the code for us to give out only the price as output<br />
    - This is done by Trial and Error method and would take some time but is totally worth it. (We can also use X_Path instead of Class) <br/>
    - In the second <a href= "https://github.com/V4g4b0nd/Webscrapping/blob/main/fuction_calling_scrape.py">script<a>, we are defining a function and is calling it at regular intervals for checking the price <br/>
    - The Third <a href = "https://github.com/V4g4b0nd/Webscrapping/blob/main/password_scrapping_github_repo's.py">Script<a> is an advanced use of Webscrapping and is used to print out the password from a Github page I am using a sample repository here as an example <a href = "https://github.com/usernam121">"Sample Repo"<a> <br/>
  
<h2>Use cases</h2>
<p align="Left">
 - We can use this script to check the price (or other parameters) of a product and help to see if the price went down  <br/>
- Also, we can make an if  statement and use this script to notify us via email or as prompt, when the product price goes below a particular value <br/>
- The password scrape can be used to find "Credentials" from a webpage or a file which contains chunks of data
